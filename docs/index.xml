      <description>I ran scoring on last year&amp;rsquo;s 2016 Dirty Dozen, mostly as a test for the upcoming 2017 race. For more details about exactly how rankings were computed from Strava, see the section on scoring.
Not surprisingly, there were some differences with the official Dirty Dozen results. Overall, we see almost twice as many people scoring points (female: 12 vs. 7, male: 46 vs. 25 people). This is probably a good thing &amp;ndash; the average rider is engaged and its not all about the top few riders.</description>

      <description>This is a fun experiment with the Strava API to compare against the official Dirty Dozen results. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of interesting data available which this only begins to explore. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to add some more analysis and additional ranking schemes later. Special thanks to Niko Kovacevic for help debugging the front-end.
Scoring The official Dirty Dozen scoring system is based on the order athletes reach the top of 13 designated hills.</description>
