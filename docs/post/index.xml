      <description>I ran scoring on last year&amp;rsquo;s 2016 Dirty Dozen, mostly as a test for the upcoming 2017 race. For more details about exactly how rankings were computed from Strava, see the section on scoring.
Not surprisingly, there were some differences with the official Dirty Dozen results. Overall, we see almost twice as many people scoring points (female: 12 vs. 7, male: 46 vs. 25 people). This is probably a good thing &amp;ndash; the average rider is engaged and its not all about the top few riders.</description>
